It can be a\n                        function or an array of strings.\n\n            space       an optional parameter that specifies the indentation\n                        of nested structures. If it is omitted, the text will\n                        be packed without extra whitespace. If it is a number,\n                        it will specify the number of spaces to indent at each\n                        level. If it is a string (such as '\\t' or '&nbsp;'),\n                        it contains the characters used to indent at each level.\n\n            This method produces a JSON text from a JavaScript value.\n\n            When an object value is found, if the object contains a toJSON\n            method, its toJSON method will be called and the result will be\n            stringified. A toJSON method does not serialize: it returns the\n            value represented by the name/value pair that should be serialized,\n            or undefined if nothing should be serialized. The toJSON method\n            will be passed the key associated with the value, and this will be\n            bound to the value\n\n            For example, this would serialize Dates as ISO strings.\n\n                Date.prototype.toJSON = function (key) {\n                    function f(n) {\n                        // Format integers to have at least two digits.\n                        return n < 10 ? '0' + n : n;\n                    }\n\n                    return this.getUTCFullYear()   + '-' +\n                         f(this.getUTCMonth() + 1) + '-' +\n                         f(this.getUTCDate())      + 'T' +\n                         f(this.getUTCHours())     + ':' +\n                         f(this.getUTCMinutes())   + ':' +\n                         f(this.getUTCSeconds())   + 'Z';\n                };\n\n            You can provide an optional replacer method. It will be passed the\n            key and value of each member, with this bound to the containing\n            object. The value that is returned from your method will be\n            serialized. If your method returns undefined, then the member will\n            be excluded from the serialization.\n\n            If the replacer parameter is an array of strings, then it will be\n            used to select the members to be serialized. It filters the results\n            such that only members with keys listed in the replacer array are\n            stringified.\n\n            Values that do not have JSON representations, such as undefined or\n            functions, will not be serialized. Such values in objects will be\n            dropped; in arrays they will be replaced with null. You can use\n            a replacer function to replace those with JSON values.\n            JSON.stringify(undefined) returns undefined.\n\n            The optional space parameter produces a stringification of the\n            value that is filled with line breaks and indentation to make it\n            easier to read.\n\n            If the space parameter is a non-empty string, then that string will\n            be used for indentation. If the space parameter is a number, then\n            the indentation will be that many spaces.\n\n            Example:\n\n            text = JSON.stringify(['e', {pluribus: 'unum'}]);\n            // text is '[\"e\",{\"pluribus\":\"unum\"}]'\n\n\n            text = JSON.stringify(['e', {pluribus: 'unum'}], null, '\\t');\n            // text is '[\\n\\t\"e\",\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\t\"pluribus\": \"unum\"\\n\\t}\\n]'\n\n            text = JSON.stringify([new Date()], function (key, value) {\n                return this[key] instanceof Date ?\n                    'Date(' + this[key] + ')' : value;\n            });\n            // text is '[\"Date(---current time---)\"]'\n\n\n        JSON.parse(text, reviver)\n            This method parses a JSON text to produce an object or array.\n            It can throw a SyntaxError exception.\n\n            The optional reviver parameter is a function that can filter and\n            transform the results. It receives each of the keys and values,\n            and its return value is used instead of the original value.\n            If it returns what it received, then the structure is not modified.\n            If it returns undefined then the member is deleted.\n\n            Example:\n\n            // Parse the text. Values that look like ISO date strings will\n            // be converted to Date objects.\n\n            myData = JSON.parse(text, function (key, value) {\n                var a;\n                if (typeof value === 'string') {\n                    a =\n/^(\\d{4})-(\\d{2})-(\\d{2})T(\\d{2}):(\\d{2}):(\\d{2}(?:\\.\\d*)?)Z$/.exec(value);\n                    if (a) {\n                        return new Date(Date.UTC(+a[1], +a[2] - 1, +a[3], +a[4],\n                            +a[5], +a[6]));\n                    }\n                }\n                return value;\n            });\n\n            myData = JSON.parse('[\"Date(09/09/2001)\"]', function (key, value) {\n                var d;\n                if (typeof value === 'string' &&\n                        value.slice(0, 5) === 'Date(' &&\n                        value.slice(-1) === ')') {\n                    d = new Date(value.slice(5, -1));\n                    if (d) {\n                        return d;\n                    }\n                }\n                return value;\n            });\n\n\n    This is a reference implementation.

Sometimes it's called a \"filter\",\n// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where\n// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would\n// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)\n//\n// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a\n// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,\n// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then\n// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.\n//\n// Here's how this works:\n//\n// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable\n// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)\n// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes\n// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until\n// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.\n//\n// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When\n// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the\n// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single\n// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first\n// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into\n// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.\n//\n// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,\n// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,\n// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering\n// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is\n// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many\n// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in\n// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small\n// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In\n// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell\n// the system to stop doing the transform.  A single 4MB write could\n// cause the system to run out of memory.\n//\n// However, even in such a pathological case, only a single written chunk\n// would be consumed, and then the rest would wait (un-transformed) until\n// the results of the previous transformed chunk were consumed.\n\nmodule.exports = Transform;\n\nvar Duplex = require('./_stream_duplex');\n\n/*<replacement>*/\nvar util = require('core-util-is');\nutil.inherits = require('inherits');\n/*</replacement>*/\n\nutil.inherits(Transform, Duplex);\n\n\nfunction TransformState(options, stream) {\n  this.afterTransform = function(er, data) {\n    return afterTransform(stream, er, data);\n  };\n\n  this.needTransform = false;\n  this.transforming = false;\n  this.writecb = null;\n  this.writechunk = null;\n}\n\nfunction afterTransform(stream, er, data) {\n  var ts = stream._transformState;\n  ts.transforming = false;\n\n  var cb = ts.writecb;\n\n  if (!cb)\n    return stream.emit('error', new Error('no writecb in Transform class'));\n\n  ts.writechunk = null;\n  ts.writecb = null;\n\n  if (!util.isNullOrUndefined(data))\n    stream.push(data);\n\n  if (cb)\n    cb(er);\n\n  var rs = stream._readableState;\n  rs.reading = false;\n  if (rs.needReadable || rs.length < rs.highWaterMark) {\n    stream._read(rs.highWaterMark);\n  }\n}\n\n\nfunction Transform(options) {\n  if (!(this instanceof Transform))\n    return new Transform(options);\n\n  Duplex.call(this, options);\n\n  this._transformState = new TransformState(options, this);\n\n  // when the writable side finishes, then flush out anything remaining.\n  var stream = this;\n\n  // start out asking for a readable event once data is transformed.\n  this._readableState.needReadable = true;\n\n  // we have implemented the _read method, and done the other things\n  // that Readable wants before the first _read call, so unset the\n  // sync guard flag.\n  this._readableState.sync = false;\n\n  this.once('prefinish', function() {\n    if (util.isFunction(this._flush))\n      this._flush(function(er) {\n        done(stream, er);\n      });\n    else\n      done(stream);\n  });\n}\n\nTransform.prototype.push = function(chunk, encoding) {\n  this._transformState.needTransform = false;\n  return Duplex.prototype.push.call(this, chunk, encoding);\n};\n\n// This is the part where you do stuff!\n// override this function in implementation classes.\n// 'chunk' is an input chunk.\n//\n// Call `push(newChunk)` to pass along transformed output\n// to the readable side.

Sometimes it's called a \"filter\",\n// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where\n// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would\n// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)\n//\n// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a\n// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,\n// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then\n// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.\n//\n// Here's how this works:\n//\n// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable\n// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)\n// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes\n// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until\n// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.\n//\n// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When\n// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the\n// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single\n// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first\n// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into\n// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.\n//\n// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,\n// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,\n// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering\n// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is\n// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many\n// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in\n// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small\n// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In\n// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell\n// the system to stop doing the transform.  A single 4MB write could\n// cause the system to run out of memory.\n//\n// However, even in such a pathological case, only a single written chunk\n// would be consumed, and then the rest would wait (un-transformed) until\n// the results of the previous transformed chunk were consumed.\n\nmodule.exports = Transform;\n\nvar Duplex = require('./_stream_duplex');\n\n/*<replacement>*/\nvar util = require('core-util-is');\nutil.inherits = require('inherits');\n/*</replacement>*/\n\nutil.inherits(Transform, Duplex);\n\n\nfunction TransformState(options, stream) {\n  this.afterTransform = function(er, data) {\n    return afterTransform(stream, er, data);\n  };\n\n  this.needTransform = false;\n  this.transforming = false;\n  this.writecb = null;\n  this.writechunk = null;\n}\n\nfunction afterTransform(stream, er, data) {\n  var ts = stream._transformState;\n  ts.transforming = false;\n\n  var cb = ts.writecb;\n\n  if (!cb)\n    return stream.emit('error', new Error('no writecb in Transform class'));\n\n  ts.writechunk = null;\n  ts.writecb = null;\n\n  if (!util.isNullOrUndefined(data))\n    stream.push(data);\n\n  if (cb)\n    cb(er);\n\n  var rs = stream._readableState;\n  rs.reading = false;\n  if (rs.needReadable || rs.length < rs.highWaterMark) {\n    stream._read(rs.highWaterMark);\n  }\n}\n\n\nfunction Transform(options) {\n  if (!(this instanceof Transform))\n    return new Transform(options);\n\n  Duplex.call(this, options);\n\n  this._transformState = new TransformState(options, this);\n\n  // when the writable side finishes, then flush out anything remaining.\n  var stream = this;\n\n  // start out asking for a readable event once data is transformed.\n  this._readableState.needReadable = true;\n\n  // we have implemented the _read method, and done the other things\n  // that Readable wants before the first _read call, so unset the\n  // sync guard flag.\n  this._readableState.sync = false;\n\n  this.once('prefinish', function() {\n    if (util.isFunction(this._flush))\n      this._flush(function(er) {\n        done(stream, er);\n      });\n    else\n      done(stream);\n  });\n}\n\nTransform.prototype.push = function(chunk, encoding) {\n  this._transformState.needTransform = false;\n  return Duplex.prototype.push.call(this, chunk, encoding);\n};\n\n// This is the part where you do stuff!\n// override this function in implementation classes.\n// 'chunk' is an input chunk.\n//\n// Call `push(newChunk)` to pass along transformed output\n// to the readable side.

Then the code starts with all zero bits\n   for the first code of the shortest length, and the codes are integer\n   increments for the same length, and zeros are appended as the length\n   increases.

See the comments in inftrees.h\n   for more information.\n\n   sym increments through all symbols, and the loop terminates when\n   all codes of length max, i.e. all codes, have been processed.
